# CSCE-501-002-Deep-Learning
In this course, three assignments are solved. Each folder contains the problem definition and solution code as well as result summary.
HW1: 1. An MLP network is manually designed using numpy library only. An XOR gate is implemented using the MLP. Both forward and backward propagation are performed for following cases: (a) Sigmoid, ReLu, and Tanh activation function; (b) Loss functions: L2_norm, cross entropy; (c) 3 forward and 2 backward passes are performed.
2. An MLP is designed with one hidden layer to perform classification task. Training, validation and testing are performed on a given dataset. Both cross entropy loss and gradient descent are applied and the evaluation is performed for 10, 100, 1000 iterations.
HW2: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier is created  for the CIFAR-10 dataset of images. Details CNN architecture can be found in the folder (CNN_CIFAR10.pdf).
HW3: A GRU cell is implemented from scratch and the results are compared with the pytorch library GRU cell.
